# RedNesto's Box O' Utils

Box O' Utils is a [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/rednestos-box-o-utils.52237//) and [Sponge](https://ore.spongepowered.org/RedNesto/Box-O'-Utils) plugin allowing server owners to do random things like harvest a crop with a right-click or customize blocks and mobs loots (for more control over the loots data, you can use FileInventories, see more [on the Wiki](https://github.com/RedNesto/BoxOUtils/wiki/FileInventories-Integration)).

The [Wiki](https://github.com/RedNesto/BoxOUtils/wiki) is here if you need help to configure the plugin.

You can join me on [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/zUgFWV8) if you have any question or feature request, but please report any bug in the issue tracker of this repository.
